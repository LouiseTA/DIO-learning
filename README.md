# 🚀 DIO Challenges & Projects

This repository contains the challenges and projects I've completed as part of various bootcamps on the [Digital Innovation One (DIO)](https://www.dio.me/) platform.  
It's focused on practicing and strengthening my skills in **programming, technology, and innovation**.

I use this space to organize my work, review key concepts, and share my learning journey with the developer community.
